Glowing owl, my attempt to make the [IKEA SOLBO table lamp](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/solbo-table-lamp-white-owl-30325696/) a little more fun (and maybe more creepy...) using programmable RGB leds and a wifi-enabled uC with the option to push firmware updates over the air using [Bintray](https://github.com/platformio/bintray-secure-ota).
